* Introduction

LB3D is an implementation of the lattice Boltzmann algorithm for ternary 
amphiphilic fluid mixtures and binary (im)miscible fluid mixtures. It is
written in Fortran90 and parallelized using MPI.

Below you find a quick start guide. Please refer to the user-manual in the
directory lb3d/doc/manual/ for further details.

* Requirements
 - Fortran compiler (Intel, IBM, Cray, GNU are known to work)
 - MPI implementaion (MPICH2, openMPI, MPVAPICH)
 - XDRF library for Fortran (Available at http://hpcv100.rc.rug.nl/xdrf.html)
 - Parallel HDF5 library (Available at http://www.hdfgroup.org)
 - GNU make
 - tar, patch, diff

To rebuild the documentation from sources
 - Doxygen 
 - pdflatex

* Installation of XDRF

 Download the xdrf library from http://hpcv100.rc.rug.nl/binaries/xdrf.tar.gz
 and unpack it into the directory lb3d/code/ 

tar xvf xdrf.tar.gz

Apply the patch provided there

patch -p0 < xdrf.patch

Done

* Configuration

Please review a suiting defines.PLATFORM file or create a new one for your platform from defines.TEMPLATE. You most likely need to adjust the compiler environment-variables and flags.

To trigger the configuration issue:

./configLB3D.sh CONFIG PLATFORM COMPILEROPTIONS

A typical example would be 

./configLB3D.sh CONFIG LINUX64 -DUSEXDRF -DUSEHDF

To compile the code to include three fluid components.

If the configuration is successful, the code can be compiled by issueing

./configLB3D.sh MAKE

If successfull, this will create a binary 'lb3d' in the directory lb3d/code/


* Running, issue for example to run two processes

mpirun -n 2 ./lb3d -f input-file

Please refer to the lb3d-manual in the directory lb3d/doc/manual/ for further 
details.
